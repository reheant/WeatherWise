WeatherWise

The goal of this project was to get familiar with API's and how information can be fetched from different sources. I created this application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app seamlessly connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time meteorological data. I also enhanced the user experience by integrating dynamic background images sourced from Unsplash based on the user's queried city. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with API integration, JSON manipulation, and user-centered design.
